<div id="steps" class="section level3">
<h3>Steps</h3>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">

<ol start="2" style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>IPEDS website provides multiple options for us to explore. To download data we need, we need to go to “<strong>Survey Data</strong>” and choose “<strong>Custom data files</strong>”.</li>
</ol>
<p><img src="images/IPEDS2.png" /></p>
<ol start="3" style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>To customize the data files, choose groups of institutions.</li>
</ol>
<p>You can make your choice based on your needs. I will take public, four-year institutions as an example, click “<strong>By Groups</strong>”, then choose “<strong>Sector</strong>” -&gt; “Public, 4-year or above”. Then, click “Search” -&gt; “<strong>CONTINUE</strong>” to step 2.</p>
<p><img src="images/IPEDS3.jpg" /></p>
<ol start="4" style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>Choose years and variables we want.</li>
</ol>
<p>I will choose 2018- 2021 with variables: “percent admitted -total”, “Percent of full-time first-time undergraduates awarded Pell grants”, and “Graduation rate, total cohort”.</p>
<p>🌻 <strong>Congratulations!</strong> Now you can download your data files!</p>
<ol start="5" style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>Download the data files.</li>
</ol>
<p>To have the data files that are easy to manipulate and import to R, choose “<strong>csv</strong>”.</p>
<p>If you can download files as a whole, you might want do that instead of download a single file.</p>
<p><img src="images/IPEDS4.jpg" /></p>
<p>With those data files, we need to extract them before importing them into R.</p>

<div id="tips" class="section level3">
<h3>👉 Tips</h3>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>Make sure that you check and understand the variables’ <a href="https://surveys.nces.ed.gov/ipeds/public/glossary">definitions</a> before you use them.</li>
<li>Make sure that you explore all relevant variables that you want. Some variables have similar names but different definitions.</li>
<li>Make sure that you download data files year by year since variables’ definition might change.</li>
<li>Explore Frequently used/ Derived variables first. It include variables that might not be in the general classification. Sometimes, it saves your time.</li>
</ol>
