    The first class I took in my Ph.D. program introduced diversity in higher education, which has had a profound influence on me. My professor, Dr. Laura Harrison, built a positive, critical, and inclusive learning environment as I first learned concepts and theories of diversity formally. The professor encouraged us to recognize our biases and perspectives, examine the underlying assumptions, and then collect as much information as we could by listening to others' opinions and thinking from others' perspectives. My classmates were from various countries; however, we shared opinions openly and challenged our biases. Even though we had conflicts and different perspectives, we respected each other and had critical discussions of our stories, biases, privileges, etc.

    Of all the class materials and discussions, I remember most vividly the concept that there is no right or wrong but a lack of information. Although that course has ended, the lessons learned in it continue to resonate with me. I believe that everyone has their own perspectives and offers information that is indispensable to seeing the whole picture. I strive to create an inclusive, safe, and supportive environment to allow everyone to communicate and share their voices. To build that environment, I keep reflecting on my privileges and biases and developing an open mind as well as listening to others with respect. Moreover, I built my cultural competency on my international experiences. I grew up in China and later pursued my Ph.D. in the U.S. where my cohorts consist of diverse people. As a student, exposure to new cultures and diversity encourages me to review my identities, worldview, values, and background. Such experiences allow me to be more empathetic to others. I understand how it feels to be an outsider when surrounded by a majority of White students and dominant culture, as well as to struggle as a bilingual student. Being an outsider might discourage one from developing a sense of belonging and fitting into the class. Not only international but other traditionally underrepresented students, such as first-generation, low-income, African American, or adult students, etc. could have this perspective when they first enter a new environment.

    When I worked as a teaching assistant to design my statistics courses and tutor students, I did not take my knowledge for granted. However, I did not assume that students are familiar with the content I teach. Instead, I explained concepts and theories in an intuitive and acute way and created a safe space for students to share their voices openly. Several of my students are adult students who knew little about statistical analysis before the class. They stated that I explained various concepts well so that they can understand them easily. Although they did not know much about statistics, they were engaged in class discussions and felt confident when communicating with others.

    In the future, I would like to continue growing my awareness and appreciation of diverse perspectives through my professional work and classroom management. I plan to keep an open mind when involved in campus activities and my work.
