### Exemplary level

### Description

I organized an one-hour workshop on instructing how to using R Markdown, informing students, instructors, and scholars to use it on learning, teaching and research.

Such a tool does not only benefit student for learning statistics, but also is useful for student affairs professionals, especially for those who focus on quantitative analysis.

I also developed my abilities in database management, data visualization, etc. in my practicum at Institutional Effectiveness and Analytics office at Ohio University.
