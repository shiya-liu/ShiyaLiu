### Foundational Level


### Description
>"The Advising and Supporting competency area addresses the knowledge, skills, and dispositions related to providing advising and support to individuals and groups through direction, feedback, critique, referral, and guidance" (p.36).

### Artifact
&ensp; &ensp;When I was a master student in Chinese, I worked with a instructor who comes from Italy as a teaching assistant. I took responsibility to work directly with around twenty undergraduate students, helping them to deal with assignments, course materials, etc after class. Through my interactions with  student, I recognized my own strengths and weakness, improved my active listening skills, and exhibited my abilities of problem-solving.

&ensp; &ensp;During my Ph.D. at Ohio University, I have also demonstrated my competency in advising and helping. I have been able to work with graduate students cohort from various countries. I was able to conduct one-on-one meetings with students to address their questions and concerns. I also successfully guided them to develop their quantitative skills and explore their research projects.
